				<p> I'm a lecturer at the Data Science Institute at Columbia University and author of the <a
					href="#book">O'Reilly book "Introduction to machine
						learning with Python"</a>, describing a
				practical approach to machine learning with python and scikit-learn.
				I am one of the core developers of the scikit-learn machine
				learning library, and I have been co-maintaining it for
				several years. I'm also a <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> instructor.
				In the past, I worked at the NYU Center for Data Science on open source and open science,
				and as Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon.
		You can find my <a href="cv_andreas_mueller.pdf">full cv here</a>.  </p>
				<p>
				My mission is to create open tools to lower the barrier of
				entry for machine learning applications, promote
				reproducible science and democratize the access to
				high-quality machine learning algorithms.</p>
